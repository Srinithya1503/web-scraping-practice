# 🕸️ Web Scraping Practice

This repository contains my practice work on **web scraping using Python**. The goal of this repo is to strengthen my understanding of data collection from websites and APIs, and to build a strong foundation for real-world data analysis projects.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

* 🐍 **Python Scripts** for web scraping
* 🌐 **Libraries Used**:

  * `BeautifulSoup` → HTML parsing
  * `Requests` → Fetching web pages
  * `Selenium` (if included) → Automating browser tasks
  * `Pandas` → Data storage & cleaning
* 📂 Different notebooks/scripts for scraping from multiple websites

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

* Understand how to **extract structured data** from HTML pages
* Handle **tags, attributes, and classes** in HTML
* Work with **pagination and navigation**
* Save scraped data into **CSV/Excel files**
* (Optional) Automate scraping using **Selenium** for dynamic websites

---

## 📝 Examples

Some of the practice tasks include:

* Scraping product details from e-commerce websites
* Extracting quotes/authors from websites like *Quotes to Scrape*
* Collecting data tables (sports stats, finance data, etc.)
* Saving cleaned data into structured files for analysis

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srinithya1503/web-scraping-practice.git
   cd web-scraping-practice
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

## 📌 Future Plans

* Add **more websites** (news, finance, job portals, etc.)
* Integrate scraping results into **data visualization** projects
* Explore advanced tools like **Scrapy**



✨ *This is part of my journey as an aspiring Data Analyst to master real-world data collection and analysis.*

👉 Do you want me to also **create a `requirements.txt`** for you (based on BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, selenium), so your repo looks more professional?
