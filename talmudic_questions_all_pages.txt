The endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium led to the formation of the photosynthetic organelle, the chloroplast. Along evolutionary history this organelle proved quite plastic; there are many non-photosynthetic variants with very different functions, e.g., chromoplasts, amyloplasts, apicoplasts. Thus, the name plastid to refer to the group. In contrast, the mitochondrion, the other organelle derived from endosymbiosis, does not display the same degree of plasticity. Why (in a teleonomic sense) such different evolutionary outcomes?

Two recent events prompt me to post this (double) Talmudic Question(s). First, I had a lot of thoughts inspired by Christoph's Monday post on stop codons being recognized by charged tRNAs in a trypanosomatid: "Stops making sense." How bizarre can non-canonical codes get? Second, I was reading posts from the past.
With the code already in mind, I was immediately struck when I landed on this gem from 2008 by the late Charley Yanofksy. (Full disclosure, Charley was my post-doctoral mentor more than forty years ago, so I may be biased.) In his post, he poses several questions related to tRNA and tRNA synthetases. Fifteen years ago, Charley felt that although the genetic code was well-established, "a very exciting unsolved problem is discovering how codons were related to amino acids in the evolution of protein synthesis." Following this statement, he posed several well-defined questions. These are my favorite two:
How did a tRNA and a tRNA synthetase first evolve, and what was their ancestral source?
How were the genes for the first tRNA and tRNA synthetase duplicated and how was their specificity varied?
His questions had a Talmudic feeling back then; I think they still do! What answers come to mind?

Mitochondria evolved from an ancestral alpha proteobacterium. However, present day mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNA) from plants and animals are very different. While animal mtDNAs are about 16.5 kb in size, plant mtDNAs range from 200 kb to 2,000 kb. Gene numbers are similar, but most of the additional mtDNA in plants is composed of large introns, repeats and non-coding regions. Animal mtDNA are also usually circular, whereas plant mtDNAs are a collection of linear DNAs, along with smaller circular and branched molecules (see here for a review).

Question: Talmudic Question #200 ‚îÄ Our Twitter Poll
Link: https://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2022/12/talmudic-question-200_poll.html
Text:
by Christoph
To celebrate our two hundredth Talmudic Question "What is the leading cause of bacterial or ar¬≠chaeal death?" we made a poll on Twitter. Thanks to our followers we received more than 100 votes, wow! We suggested the following possible answers, presented here with the results:
(This is an accumulated table of the results of two polls as Twitter only allows polls with 4 choices each.)
I will be wary of scoring the choices made by our Twitter followers, and just leave it at that. Think about it yourself ‚îÄ in good talmudic tradition! In the following, I will make some remarks on what is known about each of our proposed death causes. Since my "remarks" add up to a calcu¬≠la¬≠ted reading time of just under 8 minutes, I suggest that you simply jump to the numbered items that interest you the most; the numbering follows that of the poll.
1. Suicide  Bacterial cells can commit suicide, take Bacillus subtilis for example. Sporulation of this bacterium is a cell densi¬≠ty‚Äëde¬≠pendent response to nutrient deprivation that results in the forma¬≠tion of an endospore within the so-called "mother cell." The release of the mature spore happens by lysis of the mother cell. Membrane fissions in the mother cell releases the chromosomal DNA into the environment and preceeds degradation of the peptidogylcan. The expression of an extra¬≠cellular nuclease, NucB, that degrades the released chrDNA is triggered by the mother cell-specific sigma factor œÉK, a clear sign that this is not an accident but programmed cell death (PCD). (An asi¬≠de: the term 'apoptosis' should be avoided here, since cell biologists have reserved it for multicel¬≠lular organisms with very distinct conserved pathways for apoptosis that haven't yet been traced down to bacteria and archaea.) The suicide of a sporulating Bacillus mother cell is thus quite com¬≠parable to Japanese seppuku (often called harakiri in the West), in which the self-slayer rams a short sword into his stomach and intestines to cause himself to leak and bleed to death. It could very well be that the self‚Äëdissolution of the mother cell evolved to give the mature spore a chance to spread and not be trapped, so to speak, in the cytoplasmic soup and viscous chrDNA surround¬≠ing it (experimental evidence for this is still missing). Most certainly, however, suicide is not the leading death cause among bacilli, because in wild-type strains the proportion of sporu¬≠lating cells in a population tends to be low, in the <30% range, and is high in laboratory strains (>80%) only because they have been selected for to study, you guessed it, sporulation.
In multicellular organisms, it is common for individual cells to commit suicide for the benefit of the whole tissue, for example, during tissue remodeling in development ‚îÄ think of the "disappear¬≠ance" of the initially existing webs between the fingers of the hands in embryos. A comparable process also exists in bacteria, another case of programmed cell death (PCD) and distinct from sporulation.
When polymorphonuclear leukocytes of the human immune system sense nearby bacteria, they secrete hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in a burst to kill them during phagocytosis ("bleach" is mention¬≠ed in: death cause 6. "other"). If these bacteria happen to be related to E. coli STEC or Shigella dys¬≠enteriae carrying a 933W or H‚Äë19B prophage (phage lambda relatives), the hydrogen peroxide re¬≠leased by the leukocytes triggers the induction of the prophage in a small part of the bacterial po¬≠pulation, as studied by Lo≈õ et al. (2013). During phage propagation in the host, the phage‚Äëencoded stxAB genes are expressed and Shiga toxin synthesized. When phage propagation finally results in host lysis, the phage progeny is released together with Shiga toxin.
That's when the counter attack starts: while the B subunit of Shiga toxin docks to the membrane of human cells carrying the cognate receptor and triggers its uptake, the A subunit, once internal¬≠ized, attacks the cytosolic ribosomes, cutting and thus inactivating the ribosomal 28S rRNA, thus blocking translation. And as it is with toxins, they are not consumed by one-time use. Cells with inactivated ribosomes are doomed. Whether one can speak of "altruism" here remains to be dis¬≠cussed. What is clear, however, is that the self‚Äësacrifice of a few bacterial cells promotes the sur¬≠vival of the entire population.
2. Exhaustion  In the disqus comments section for TQ #200, our reader Morris39 remarked (com¬≠plained?) that "starvation" is missing from the list of death causes. There is no doubt that for bac¬≠teria in the laboratory, "starvation" is the primary cause of death after nutrients are depleted. In E. coli, for example, the death phase begins after approximately one week into stationary phase with successive lysis of the culture. Note that it is not so much the lack of nutrients that causes death, but the lack of efficient disposal of toxic metabolic end products in a contained culture and shifts in pH. But then, and this is noteworthy, there is a small percentage of cells that keep them¬≠¬≠selves alive for long time periods in the mass grave of a culture by gorging on cadavers, "GASPing for life in stationary phase" as Mechas Zambrano and Roberto termed this habit. In such a station¬≠ary culture, feeble growth and death balance each other such that the cell number remains almost constant over many months.

Flores, C.I.C.I.C., Uni¬≠versidad de Sevilla, Spain. Frontispiece: Single plaques of Salmonella phage PRD1 on agar plate. By B. Henze, Leibniz In¬≠sti¬≠tute DSMZ. Source
Unlike E. coli, bacteria like Deinococcus radiodurans and a number of cyanobacteria cannot be starved to death. Fila¬≠mentous cyanobacteria like Nostoc or Anabaena form so-called Akinetes within strings of cells (Figure 1) under unfa¬≠vorable growth conditions. Akinetes come close to Bacillus spores with respect to long-term resistance to adverse phy¬≠sical conditions, they're not heat resistant though. The sur¬≠vival skills of Deinococcus are by all means extreme (see here STC). In a recent post from 2021, Elio wrote:"‚ÄâD. radio¬≠durans [also] placed outside the International Space Sta¬≠tion, revealed that cells in pellets 500 microns thick stayed alive after 3 years in space. Once cultivated, they repaired their damaged DNA via the products of uvrA gene (nucleo¬≠tide excision repair) and uvdE gene (UV-damage excision repair)." Under space conditions there is certainly no such thing as "dormancy" or "hibernation" or even "suspended animation," and biology lacks an apt term for this form of unlife.
"Exhaustion" in bacteria could also mean the de¬≠cli¬≠ne of their "re¬≠pro¬≠duc¬≠ti¬≠ve out¬≠put," in other words senescence. That's exactly what Martin Ackermann studied in Cau¬≠lo¬≠bact¬≠er cres¬≠cen¬≠tus, a bacterium with a dimorphic life cycle (see here is STC). Briefly, a "stalked cell" attaches to a sub¬≠strate via the holdfast on the tip of its stalk, grows, and subsequently divides, with the mother cell remaining at¬≠tached while the flagellated daughter cell, the "swarmer cell," takes flight (and turns into a stalked cell once it finds a suitable substrate, thus completing the cycle). By flushing away the swarmers with fresh medium and counting division events in the stalkers, he found that Cau¬≠lo¬≠bac¬≠ter‚Äâcells do indeed gradually age and cea¬≠se di¬≠vi¬≠ding af¬≠ter 60‚Äâge¬≠ne¬≠ra¬≠tions, on ave¬≠ra¬≠ge. While some cells pro¬≠du¬≠ced up to 130‚Äâpro¬≠ge¬≠ny cells in 300‚Äâhours, most stop¬≠ped di¬≠vi¬≠ding or di¬≠vi¬≠ded more slow¬≠ly with in¬≠crea¬≠s¬≠ing age.
Yet, what is true for Caulobacter must not necessarily be true for elephants or E. coli. Wang et al. (2010) seeded cells of two distantly related E. coli strains, B/r and MG1655, into microfluidic chan¬≠nels and followed the steady-state growth of ~105 individual "mother" cells over >100 generations, that is, cell divisions visible by microscopic inspection. They found strikingly constant growth rates of mother cells and their immediate sister cells for hundreds of generations. Despite this robust growth, cells died due to accumulation of damages during the course of the experiments. This was most evident in MG1655 lexA3 mutant cells that are unable to respond to damage via the SOS re¬≠sponse and had a constant mortality rate of ~3% from the start. In contrast, the death rate wild ¬≠type MG1655 cells gradually increased from <0.1% at start to reach <2% after 150 generations. The authors concluded:"from the qualitative difference in death rate between MG1655 and its lexA3 mutant derivative (...) that death of E. coli cells cannot be due to random events such as DNA da¬≠mage but must be a consequence of growth-independent accumulation of lethal element." Death by a "lethal element" but not senescence or "exhaustion" ‚îÄ this isn't easy to comprehend.
3. Murder by kin  I was a bit surprised at how few of our survey participants considered "murder by kin" to be a relevant cause of death for bacteria. It is now well known that bacteria and archaea in the wild prefer to congregate in biofilms. And such aggregates are the venue for every conceiv¬≠able form of cooperation and competition, and this applies to mixed‚Äëspecies and mono‚Äëspecies biofilms alike. When it comes to co‚Äëinhabitants in biofilms, Vibrio cholerae, for example, are not squeamish: all other bacteria that come close enough to them are first shot on suspect ‚îÄ with their T6SS ‚îÄ and only if those hit have an antidote to the injected toxin do they survive this "identi¬≠ty check." This may well be kin, that is, a genetically almost identical Vibrio cholerae lacking the an¬≠tidote. We had described this murder in the family setting in detail here, and mentioned that it is by no means restricted to the Vibrios. Several "secretion systems" ‚îÄ we currently know nine ‚îÄ are widespread among bacteria, and they probably all serve the purpose of keeping unwanted neigh¬≠bors at arm's length, whether they are from the closer or more distant family.
Figure 2. (C) A high density of phage par¬≠ticles within Wolbachia is shown; phage tails are occasionally visible and noted by white arrowheads in the inset. Bar=200 nm; inset bar=100 nm. (D) Virion-free (lo¬≠wer right) and virion-containing Wol¬≠bachia (upper right) localized near two N. vitripennis spermatids are shown. Solid ar¬≠rowheads denote phage particles in¬≠side Wolbachia, and Ax and Md denote spermatid axonemes and mitochondrial derivatives, respectively. Bar = 200 nm. Source
4. Predation by phages  By a wide margin, the preferred cause of death of bacteria and archaea in our poll (see fron¬≠tispiece). And indeed, to my knowledge, there are no de¬≠scribed bacteria and archaea that are not preyed upon by well over a dozen species‚Äëspecific phages (including those with a broad host range). Not even those that sport multiple sophisticated phage defense systems escape phage preda¬≠tion, but individual cells may. And this is also true for those species that we know only from their genome sequences, which usually contain integrated prophage genomes or tell¬≠tale remnants thereof.
I pick here only one particularly impressive example, the phage WO, which has accompanied Wolbachia since this bacterium infected more than half of all known arthropods and settled there as endosymbiont (and has dramatic influ¬≠ences on the sex of the host's offspring). It is difficult to estimate, let alone measure, the contribu¬≠tion of phage WO to the death rate of intracellular Wolbachia (Figure 2).
5. Predation by protists  In the lab, protists are most often successfully fed with bacteria, well‚Äë‚Äâknown examples being Acanthamoeba (see here in STC) and, of course, Dictyostelium. The latter eats away holes in a bacterial lawn that look like clear phage plaques at first glance (Figure 3). From such artificial lab conditions, under which "killing by protists" is the main cause of death for bacteria, it is of course not possible to extrapolate to conditions in the wild, or even in the human gut.
In the upper layers of the oceans, the number of picocyanobacteria doubles about every 2 days, but since their concentrations remain quite stable for weeks, regardless of seasonal fluctuations, half of them must either die and lyse, or fall prey to predators, mostly both the ubiquitous cyano¬≠phages and protists. Although by orders of magnitude less abundant than phages and bacteria, both heterotrophic and phototrophic protists, which often go "sideways" in their feeding, are ef¬≠ficient hunters. For example, a single Proro¬≠cent¬≠rum dinoflagellate ‚îÄ more a trapper than a hunter ‚îÄ can easily catch ~50 prokaryotic cells per day in its mucosphere for immediate consumption (see here in STC).
Figure 3. Dictyostelium (clear plaques) feed¬≠ing on a lawn of Klebsiella bacteria (white). Image by Sam Manna
It is only anecdotal and therefore not really scientifically re¬≠levant, but I vividly remember the horror that haunted Blan¬≠ca Perez Sepulveda during her PhD in David Scanlan's lab at Warwick University, UK, that the "grazers," the omnivorous protists, would decimate her precious long-term Synechococ¬≠cus cultures; she found it much easier to tame the phages.
6. Other causes  Alex Bisson (@Archaeon_Alex) suggested bleach as one of "other causes," and that was indeed appro¬≠priate as physicians and microbiologists often use it for ef¬≠ficient surface disinfection. In more natural settings, chlo¬≠rine-based bleaches won't play a large role as chlorine is simply too reactive with anything that is even remotely oxidizable. This is different for peroxide-based bleaches as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (‚Ä¢O2‚àí), which belong to the reactive oxygen species (ROS), are byproducts of cell metabolism in all domains of life.
Many bacteria avoid being killed by ROS by the production of catalases, enzymes with among the highest known turnover numbers. Unless they can't, which is the case in picocyanobacteria. This deficiency in catalase in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus results in their failure to form colo¬≠nies on solid media unless they are grown in the presence of "helper" bacteria like catalase-posi¬≠tive Alteromonas (first explored by Morris et al. (2008) and also briefly mentioned here in STC).
Conclusion  For all the death causes we asked about, they do occur in nature and in the lab. Each of them is the main death cause of individual bacterial cells under certain conditions. But it is per¬≠haps presumptuous to try to pin down a single cause of death as the predominant one among bacteria and archaea in general. This could also be a valid answer to our Talmudic Question, but was not given as a choice in the poll. Our fault. Or, was it?

Question: The Vicissitudes of a Talmudic Question
Link: https://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2019/03/the-vicissitudes-of-a-talmudic-question.html
Text:
by Elio
When we try to construct a Talmudic Question, we are concerned with the accuracy of the premise and ensuring that an answer has not been previously provided. We were toying with this one: ‚ÄúBacterial endosymbionts of insects have reduced genomes but, best we know, they have not exported some of their genes to the host cell nucleus (as organelles have). If this is indeed true, what is the reason for it?‚Äù But we were not sure of the premise, so we thought it wise to consult with an expert, John McCutcheon, of the University of Montana. Here is what he said:
Aphid on a Leaf. Source
‚ÄúEndosymbionts do seem to have transferred genes, but rarely. In some cases, there are transfers that seem to have come from the endosymbionts (but this is quite difficult to prove, although the phylogenetic trees suggest it‚Äôs true or at least possible). In the vast majority of cases, however, the genes transferred to insect host genomes are from other bacteria, in particular the reproductive manipulators such as Wolbachia.
Why? Because reproductive manipulators have the opportunity. Reproductive manipulators are, as part of their normal lifecycle, exposed to the nuclei of insect germ cells. Nutritional endosym¬≠bionts are found in insect eggs, true, but for cell biological reasons they seem to be unable to easily transfer genes. The endosymbionts with the smallest genomes do not have much opportu¬≠nity to transfer genes, reproductive manipulators do.
But these HGTs arising from reproductive manipulators still complement missing endosymbiont genes, so I see this as basically the same outcome, achieved through a slightly different process. These transfers still enable some aspects of genome reduction, but the genes happen to come from other sources because other sources have more opportunity to transfer genes. So, at least in my head, this is an interesting problem, but perhaps not a Talmudic one‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs solved!
The other thing that seems to be going on in many endosymbioses is that native host genes are taking over some of the functions of the missing endosymbiont genes. This seems to be true in many insect-endosymbiont systems, and it also is true in other host-endosymbiont systems such as the amoeba Paulinella. So, to sum up, it seems that many (non-organelle) endosymbionts can have such small genomes through (i) HGT from various sources and (ii) functional takeover from the host.‚Äù
However, John thought later that it wasn‚Äôt quite so simple. He wrote: ‚ÄúWell, just to be clear, this is a problem that is solved in *my* head (although the mechanisms are almost completely unsolved!), but I do think that some people might not know this. So maybe it‚Äôs still an interesting thing to dis¬≠cuss on the blog.‚Äù We follow his advice.

1. Bacteriophages are usually very specific, so it is reasonable to believe that it wouldn't infect a eukaryote, outside a kingdom range. However, nature is full of exceptions. We may have surprises left.
2. I'm thinking why not? For example, In case of HIV, viral RNA have been found inside mitochondria. Herpes can directly induce mitochondrial degradation, but is not a prime requirement for replication. In case of Flock house virus, RNA replication occurs on outer mitochondrial membranes. Nodamura virus is another debated example (here and here). Given that mitochondria and chloroplast have their own genetic material still left (despite most of it being lost during evolution) makes the question valid to be explored to a degree.

I'm not sure, but on a related note I just learned from a friend that the bacterium Midichloria mitochondrii infects mitochondria. You probably already knew that, but how interesting!
Comment #4 by Hollis Marriott
Being an interested but naive reader (macro-biologist), I‚Äôm wondering if the phage-type RNA polymerases in plants are relevant? "In mono- and eudicotyledonous plants, a small nuclear gene family (RpoT, RNA polymerase of the T3/T7 type) encodes mitochondrial as well as chloroplast RNA polymerases homologous to the T-odd bacteriophage enzymes." (Source). I don't know if there's a generally accepted hypothesis as to origin, but in searching I found this: "Together these two findings add weight to the hypothesis of a podoviral origin of nuclear encoded phage type RNA polymerases. Considering a subsequent gene transfer from mitochondria to the nucleus, a prophage that might have been part of the Œ±-proteobacterial endosymbiont's genome or an active podoviral phage, present in the Œ±-proteobacterial ancestor of mitochondria at the time of the endosymbiotic uptake, is therefore a likely source for nuclear encoded phage-type RNA polymerases." p 28 of http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/disse...
In any case ‚Ä¶ in almost total ignorance I'm betting that somewhere there are phages involved with mitochondria and chloroplasts. With all the cool new things being found, it would have to be! :-) Thanks for the great TQs.
Comment #5 by Kanika Khanna
Fernando Vargas, Neeraja Vegesna, and myself (Kanika) presented these questions in our Microbiology class at UCSD. This is a compilation of our opinions. Waiting for a good discussion on these points!
To understand why bacteriophages don't infect eukaryotic cells, let us first look at how phages and viruses infect bacteria bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Phages enter bacterial cells by binding to a surface receptor (lipopolysaccharide, cell wall/flagellar proteins, and pilus proteins) and injecting its genetic material using its tail. The genetic material then gets integrated into the bacterial chromosome where it hijacks the cell to aid in its replication.
Virus particles enter eukaryotic cells using mechanisms like pinocytosis, receptor mediated endocytosis (via clathrin/claveolin mediated pathways) and/or membrane fusion where it is decapsidated inside the cell and end up in the lytic or lysogenic cycles.
Perhaps there are many reasons as to why bacteriophages cannot infect eukaryotic cells. One can argue that they are incapable of infecting eukaryotic cells because phages don't have the required ligands for a receptor mediated endocytosis like infection. Furthermore, even if they are somehow recognized by and incorporated into the cell, they may need to undergo decapsidation, which is not known in phages, for effective infection.
So, if we were to do an experiment to verify whether an unknown phage can infect a eukaryotic cell, we can proceed with the classic "Hershey-Chase" experiment. Bacteria will be cultured in media supplemented with phosphorous isotope (32P) for around four hours before phage introduction. It is expected that the phage progeny will contain radioactive isotopes in their structures. The labelled progeny will then be used to infect eukaryotic cells, followed by the extraction of bacterial genomic DNA. The genomic DNA will then be run on a gel while probing for 32P-incorporated genomic DNA. If the phage has indeed infected the eukaryotic cell, we would expect to see a band under the conditions mentioned. A follow up experiment to investigate if phages can infect mitochondria or chloroplast would follow a similar strategy except that we fractionate the cells and extract the genomic DNA found in mitochondria and chloroplast separately from the nucleus and check for the presence of 32P-labeled phage DNA separately in each of these.
A study was conducted by Poul and Marks, wherein the authors re-engineered F5 phage (displaying an antibody) to infect eukaryotic cells by binding to mammalian growth factor receptors, undergoing receptor-mediated endocytosis and resulted in expression of a reporter gene (GFP) inserted into the bacteriophage genome. Now this is something completely novel although we wonder whether GFP expression is due to infection or an artifact of endocytosis, the authors don't perform many experiments to verify this. But still it will be interesting to go ahead and explore more on this as it can has several applications like gene delivery etc.
Recently, researchers have discovered unusual similarities within the RNA polymerases found in mitochondria, chloroplasts and of T7 phage. Perhaps, phages infected ancestral bacteria that more closely resembled mitochondria and/or chloroplasts which was being incorporated into eukaryotic cells. Perhaps during this endocytosis event, a phage made its entry into the cell and donated its DNA code for the RNA polymerase enzyme, resulting in the observed similarity. Were this the case, it may be possible for phages to infect eukaryotic cells in indirect ways, possibly by infecting a bacteria with phages and use that infected bacterial cell to infect the eukaryotic cell.
So, all in all there may be different ways in which phages may indirectly infect eukaryotes. May be they infect bacteria first which then go on to infect the eukaryotic cells or under some circumstances, phage particles lyse and just bits and pieces of DNA or protein goes into the eukaryotic cell by pinocytosis which may not have any dire consequences. Alternatively, when the eukaryotic cell is undergoing endocytosis, some phages or phage particles present in the vicinity (a by-chance event!) may get into the cell. It is unheard of, but definitely probable.

Question: Precision of Cell Division (Talmudic Question #112.2)

Figure 1. Measurements from electron micro- graphs of agar filtered cells, taken from the thesis of F.J. Trueba (Amsterdam, 1981). A E. coli B/rK grown in glucose+CASA minimal medium. B E. coli B/rK grown in alanine+proline minimal medium.
In Talmudic Question #112, the question was asked: "Many, perhaps most bacteria, divide into daughter cells of almost precisely the same size. Why is that?"
An answer may be found when measuring the precision of cell division as a function of cell shape. The precision of cell division is given by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the ratio of the lengths of prospective daughter cells to the lengths of constricting cells (the so-called K(L) distribution; Trueba, 1982). This CV varies with the shape of the cells as defined by the cell's aspect ratio between average cell length and cell diameter (L/2R).
Measurements of constricting cells prepared for electron microscopy by the method of agar filtration (see Fig. 1, taken from the thesis of F.J. Trueba, Amsterdam, 1981), show that fast growing, thicker cells divide more precisely (CV ‚âà 5%) than the slow growing,thinner cells (CV ‚âà 10%).
If nucleoid occlusion plays a role in signaling cell division, the positioning of the whole, duplicated nucleoid in the cell will influence the site of division. As evident from the images of the cells in Fig. 2, that have about the same cellular volume and the same DNA-mass, the nucleoid has less space along the length axis of thicker the cell (Fig. 2A) than of the thinner cells (Fig. 2B), for geometrical reasons. Trueba (1982) suggested that if the position of the nucleoid in the cell is more variable, so will be the site of cell division. As far as I know this has not been measured directly using, for instance, DAPI-stained, living cells.
Figure 2. Electron micrographs of thin-sectioned cells of two different E. coli B/r strains. At doubling times exceeding 60 min, the two strains have been shown to adopt widely different cell shapes (Woldringh et al. (1977). A E. coli B/r ATCC12407 growing with a doubling time of 90 min. B E. coli B/rK, doubling time 70 min. Note the nucleoid-free cell ends. A and B have the same magnification.
The suggestion is only valid if the DNA mass is equally dispersed within the volume of the nucleoid; another Talmudic question?

Question: A Gathering of Comments on a Talmudic Question

Text:
by Elio
First it may be appropriate to repeat what we mean by Talmudic Questions (and therefore Talmu¬≠dic Answers.) We use the term loosely to denote questions that may lack definitive answers but that open the door to ingenuity and dialectic. These questions embody the musings: "I have often wondered about‚Ä¶" We are fond of saying that answers to such questions are not likely to be found by a Google search.
Our Talmudic Question #81 (Given that most mutations are deleterious, why does the mutation rate not evolve to zero?) elicited especially lucid comments. Here we sum¬≠marize a few only (and apologize to those whose com¬≠ments are not mentioned).
Jan Spitzer points out that the human mutation rate is very slow indeed. But, he notes: something else is afoot: very fast growth and mutations of 'memes.'
Daniel Smith posits that most mutations are in fact not deleterious. He says: I think the mutations we notice are certainly more likely to be deleterious. But what's science without a little sample bias?
John Wilkins cleverly points out that: Any mechanism that might keep the mutation rate low would be subjected to deleterious mutations...
Ramy Aziz tells us: Problem is: it cannot evolve to zero unless it is not zero. If mutation rate slows down to near zero, evolution will also slow down, and the probability of a ‚Äòbeneficial‚Äô mutation of ‚Äòno mutation‚Äô will be astronomically low.
MB thinks that: A mutation rate of zero can be good for an individual organism, but deleterious to a population because of selective pressures. Hence good for population, bad for individual, and evolution/selection works on populations.
Liz says something similar: Zero mutation rate means no variation and thus the halt of evolution through the loss of environmental adaptability. This decreases the fitness of an organism that achieves this state versus one that allows some mutations, even if most of these would be deleterious.
 .
Ami Bachar goes further: In earth or earth-like environments, where evolution is the base for all life, there cannot be such a thing as evolution to zero mutation rate.
Thinking about possible mechanisms, Mike Jones writes: Is there a level of noise that is unavoid¬≠able during replication?
And, similarly, Nick Matzke offers this: Because error-checking and correcting the DNA takes energy, organisms have a limited amount of energy, and thus at some point the cost of error-checking outweighs the benefits.
Mark Martin suggests that we pay attention to viruses: It also reminds me of the ‚Äòno proofread¬≠ing‚Äô problem with RNA polymerases. RNA viruses using that enzyme for replication are extremely prone to mutation, and make many defective progeny (do we have a number for that?). Yet the ‚Äòlottery winners‚Äô have their shot, as well.
And lastly, Nathan Myers muses: So, here we are, bobbing about in a seething cauldron of mu¬≠tating viruses with our exons and memes and vaccines and recombinant gene therapy. The Joneses, next cauldron over, have all that and mutations besides. Eventually the viruses cough up a mutation our civilized library of adaptability cannot best. Soon only Joneses bob about in our cauldron.

We recently asked this Talmudic Question as our TQ #71:
As NASA‚Äôs hotshot exobiologist, you are asked to design an Earth satellite system in which some organism(s) can live actively (i.e.. no spores) for millennia. How would you go about it? Specify an orbit of your choice.
Ami Bachar replied:
I would take a clean coca cola bottle, fill it half with soil and half with sea water, and make sure it stays liquid for the next 1000 years. "Everything is everywhere and the environment selects" (Martinus Beijerinck) + "life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans" (John Lennon). If it is well closed and nothing escape from the bottle than there should be enough of everything needed to sustain life for much longer than a millennia.
To which I (Elio) replied: The simplicity of your proposal wins out over all the complex schemes that I had dreamt up. Good for you!
It turns out that I jumped the gun. It's not so simple, as fellow blogger Russell Neches insightfully pointed out.
Feeling a bit giddy with sleep deprivation (and the first successful run on our lab's new sequencing machine), I decided to take a crack at Talmudic Question #71:
As NASA's hotshot exobiologist, you are asked to design an Earth satellite system in which some organism(s) can live actively (i.e., no spores) for millennia. How would you go about it? Specify an orbit of your choice.
Ami Bachar gamely suggested entrusting a cargo of seawater and dirt to a Coca Cola bottle, and lobbing it into orbit. I liked this idea so much that I couldn't resist embroidering it.
This is a fascinating idea. Could you create the happy conditions we enjoy here on the surface of this planet, but without the planet? Could you do it without cheating with moving parts, power sources, or other un-planet-like features? Fortunately, the audience we're trying to please are microbes, who aren't as finicky as astronauts.
The first problem is that Coke has never, to my knowledge, designed bottles that will stop hard UV radiation, X-rays, or relativistic protons. Such a bottle would never make it past the product safety laws, even those from Coke's early days. The glass would need to be doped with a double-handful of lead to stop at least some of the UV and X-rays, and perhaps some low-Z metal like beryllium (which is possibly more toxic than lead) to slow solar particles before they reach our precious mud. Otherwise, during a solar storm, the bottle could be sterilized by Bremsstrahlung radiation. Even thus enhanced beyond beverage container specifications, the glass probably wouldn't do nearly as good a job as the ozone layer and the Earth's magnetic field. Good thing microbes are tough.
The next problem to worry about is temperature. An object in a shady spot on the moon will cool to -153 ¬∞C, and in a sunny spot will heat to 107 ¬∞C. The Earth's average temperature is about 13 ¬∞C. How hot would it get inside the bottle? The key to the puzzle is the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:
I = œÉT4
where the constant œÉ is called, naturally, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the sun's photosphere (about 6000 Kelvin), and I is the power emitted per square meter. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can calculate that the sun's surface emits 7.3√ó107 watts per square meter. Multiplied by the total surface area of the sun, that's 3.9√ó1026 watts. This energy spreads out more-or-less uniformly through space in all directions. When you spread it over a 96-million-mile radius sphere, you get 1367 watts per square meter. This number is Earth's solar constant (S0).
The Earth absorbs a disk of this sunlight (œÄr2), but the energy is spread over the surface of a sphere (4œÄr2), so the average amount of energy falling on a square meter of the Earth is one quarter of the solar constant, or 342 watts per square meter. A Coke bottle isn't a sphere, but it's also not made out of thick lead/beryllium glass either. This is a very special Coke bottle.
About 30% of the light that reaches the surface is reflected back into space (this is called albedo, which astronomers spend a fair amount of time worrying about). The albedo reduces the energy available for heating to 240 watts per square meter. Using the Stefan-Boltzman Law, this gives us a temperature of 255K, or -18 ¬∞C. This is the Earth's average equilibrium radiating temperature, which it fortunately never reaches, thanks to our wonderful atmosphere. Don't let anyone tell you that the greenhouse effect is a bad thing! All things in moderation, of course.
In the Earth's atmosphere, water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane are opaque to infrared, but transparent to visible light. A great deal of sunlight comes down as visible light, heats up the ground, and gets re-radiated by infrared. Because of these greenhouse gasses, some of this infrared heats up the atmosphere, which then re-radiates both into space and back at the ground. (Actual garden greenhouses do not work this way at all; they simply block heat losses from convection by trapping the air inside.)
This extra radiation from the atmosphere heats up the ground, which then re-radiates a bit more. This extra heat leads, of course, to more re-radiation from the ground, which also warms the atmosphere. It's a cute little problem; each time you go around, you throw half the heat into space, half the heat back at the ground, and you get a geometric series that converges at 2. If the Earth's atmosphere were a perfect greenhouse, the average temperature would be 58¬∞C.
Going back to the Coke bottle, we can choose a temperature between -18 ¬∞C and 58 ¬∞C by setting the strength of the greenhouse effect. We'll be careful to choose mud of the right color to approximate the Earth's albedo. To do the job of Earth's greenhouse gasses, we can use an optical infrared filter, like the ones used in digital cameras. The bottle would need to be triple walled to minimize heat loss from conduction, with the middle wall acting as the filter.
One of the features of our planet that has allowed life to keep its foothold here despite an unstable climate is that our planet has a nice variety of temperature zones. When the planet warms, the temperate zones march toward the poles, and when the planet cools, they march toward the equator. The Earth owes this feature to its size and its curvature. Even if the bottle were a sphere rotating about an axis, like a miniature model of the Earth, the heat conduction in the mud would keep it at basically the same temperature throughout, despite getting more radiation at its "equator."
To set up a temperature gradient, we'll need some kind of heat flow through the mud, from a source to a sync. All we need to do is dial up the greenhouse effect, and add a sync. Letting heat "leak" out of the bottle from a specific place is easy; just add a bit of metal that sticks through the layers of the bottle, with a little heat sync dangling out into space. Without a source of heat, the heat sync would tend toward -18 ¬∞C. You could think of this as the bottle cap.
This would help encourage ecologically distinct bands, which would help preserve and generate diversity. This would be important for keeping things going as conditions changed.
After all this, the experiment probably wouldn't last a thousand years. What makes the Earth so wonderful is that it has a lot of semi-separated compartments and a lot of big gradients. Conditions change constantly and sometimes catastrophically, but there is always a comfortable place somewhere.
Obviously, the ecology of the Coke bottle world not even remotely resemble the Earth's. Carbon cycling, phosphorous cycling, and nitrogen cycling would work completely differently. The reservoirs of inorganic material would be different, and the pathways into and out of those reservoirs would be different. We would expect very different dynamics. My guess is that almost all of the available inorganic materials would eventually be incorporated into biomass, with only a very small amount made available by secretions and cells that happened to die. Perhaps this would lead to never-ending microbial gladiatorial combat, or perhaps it would be a quiet little garden wheeling through space. Perhaps you'd end up with nothing but cellular wreckage and a giant wad of phage.
Anyway, before attempting this experiment, I would strongly recommend finding a way to freeze Richard Lenski for a thousand years and thaw him out unharmed. Someone is going to get to analyze the aliquots from the Coke bottle. As nice as Richard is, I think he might run over the rest of us with cleats on to be the guy to do it.
I'd like to thank Aric Mine in Albert Colman's lab, as well as Samuel Miller and Genna Patton at the University of Chicago, for their suggestions and corrections.

Very well done! and thanks much for honouring my answer with a reply, it sure is a nice answer and one we can learn from. I would like to reply with only two points and in anyway say that I fully agree with the above answer.
1) I said in the original text "make sure it stays liquid for the next 1000 years" and by that I meant that it should be well protected from freezing or heating too much. Why would such a thing heat so much during the coming 1000 years I do not know. As far as I was told, space is rather cold. I might be wrong there. In anyway, keep it liquid, meaning, keep it somewhere around room temp.
2) UV is indeed a good point, although I think it will only penetrate to the upper 0.5mm‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâso the inner microbes should be protected. With respect to the proton flux, I do not know much. Around the earth there should be some magnetic shield for that. Not so sure about the drum system as well since potentially you can make the thing orbit the earth in a way that it experiences day-night shifts (it depends probably on how far the orbit is from earth. Adding a gradient screen is a good idea. A Winogradsky column is an upgrade of the bottle idea to augment biodiversity (although I suspect most species would be on the inner section where it is dark).
Russell Neches says "provide as many niches as possible" and I fully agree. It would definitely not hurt to have larger niches, e.g., salt water, fresh water, soil + water, soil only of different kinds, etc. Good call, although not as simple as 1 Coca Cola bottle‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâyou must admit :). A system can be VERY complex with many many devics and gradients and niches‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâno doubt, but the question was to provide a system that can sustain active organisms. You can do so with 1$ Billion and you can do it with 1$. Finally, one small question‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâI didn't understand: Why did you say "That probably wouldn't work for a thousand years either, but it's getting closer"? what is preventing from this ecosystem with an outer energy source (light) to keep recycling itself? Thanks for a good answer.

In recent years, the use of radioactive isotopes has diminished considerably in microbiological re¬≠search. What has been lost in the process?
Commentary by Elio
Source
This is a nostalgia trip. Molecular microbiologists of my generation re¬≠lied on the use of radioactive isotopes for much of their research. In those days, the size of a de¬≠partment's research effort could be mea¬≠sured by the number of scintillation counters it had at its disposal. Ra¬≠dioactivity was a convenient way of detecting and quan¬≠titating very small amounts of cell constituents. This has now been superseded by fluorescence and other non-radioactive methods. However, there are some things that radioactive isotopes do best. Thus, they are still in use. Here are two such uses.
These days, when I mention radioactive isotopes, the response I get tends to focus on the dangers of working with them. Well, in the past we were not only careful but also aware of what constitutes danger. Mostly, we worked under safe conditions. Or so we thought. And I'm still around, many millicuries of 32P later.

True to our intent, these have been questions that have no definitive an¬≠swers but most of the responses offered thoughtful con¬≠jectures. The pleasure resides in contemplating the ques¬≠tion. What deeper meaning lies therein?
As an aside, the question "how many angels can dance on the head of a pin" may sound Talmudic but actually has a totally different origin, as discussed here.
The source of these Talmudic Questions? Notably, about one quarter were submitted by aficionados among our readers, and we are mighty glad for it. Those are among the very best.

This is our first multiple-part question.
If one believes (as some out there do) that there was a free-living LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor), then what kind of lipids did it have?
I. If eubacterial, then explain why it would evolve the archaebacterial type in the presence of a good lipid synthesis solution. (Bonus question: And why was that only done once?)
II. If archaebacterial, then return to I) for the converse solution (with bonus).
III. If both, explain why we do not invoke differential loss for everything that distinguishes archaebacteria from eubacteria, and explain what is wrong with Ford Doolittle's strong Genome of Eden argument, while recalling that LGT (lateral gene transfer) only explains similarities, not differences (an interesting observation).
IV. If none, suggest what might have served to contain organics from their environment en route to self replication, recalling the so-called concentration problem (molecules must meet to react).
V. If dissatisfied with I-IV, suggest where the LUCA might have got going as a non-free-living entity.
VI. If disgusted with all of the foregoing, suggest a solution to compartmentation from the environment and the universality of chemiosmosis (except in a few derived fer¬≠menters that live off autrotrophs) that circumvents I-V, recalling that thermodynamics is not just a good idea, it's the law. Put another way, thermodynamics is as close as it gets to a genuine logical constraint in biology.
VII. If this leads you into origin of life literature, explain why it is written mostly by chemists and physicists who, by trade, do not understand much about microbes (their explanandum).
VIII. Alternatively, formulate a better question.
Bill is at the Botanical Institute III, University of D√ºsseldorf

Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is notorious for causing dis¬≠ease across vast taxonomic terrain (insects, worms, vertebrates, plants). Which viruses have a comparably wide host range?
Elio adds later:
The comments on this Talmudic Question have been both enlightening and varied. I should now pipe in with another candidate for a virus that has a particularly wide host range, the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV, Rhabdoviridae). I had long known that VSV infects mammals and insects, but then some time ago I heard Sean Whelan from Harvard mentioning that it can be induced to infect yeast as well, although this is certainly not a natural host. He supplied the following references:

The virus also replicates in C. elegans (for which there are currently no known natural viruses).

You are stranded on a desert island. During a walk on the beach, you stub your toe against a bottle, which rolls against a rock and breaks. A genie is liberated, eager to grant you one wish. You ask for a microbiological la¬≠bo¬≠ratory fully equipped to your specifications. The genie grants you that but with the condition that you can study only one sample. What sample would you collect for study, what would you do with it, and why?

All living creatures are born, grow, reproduce and finally die. Consequently, as many flow without discontinuity from one cell to the next (Escherichia coli in the gut), a number of them do not grow (Salmonella enterica inside some phagosomes), others fail to reproduce (Mycobac¬≠terium tuberculosis in latent infection) and, finally, some do not even die (Bacillus subtilis after sporulation) are bacteria alive?

With the buzz created by the discovery of giant viruses, for example Mimivirus, the distinction between viruses and cells is said to get blurred. I maintain that this is not the case because the single most important distinction is that viruses lose their corporeal integrity, cells do not. What do you think? Are you a blurrer or a non-blurrer?

Both of the scenarios proposed by David Lipson in an¬≠swer to TQ #4 make perfect sense, but they only focus on bacteria external to plants and animals (as prompted in the question).
